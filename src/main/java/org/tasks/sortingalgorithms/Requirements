Write a function that is able to sort the elements in a list in a few different ways:
    1. sort by size
    2. sort by size reversed
    3. sort by number of chars

You can use this list as a reference: [8, 98, 1, 45, 435, -2, 87, -143, Integer.MAXIMUM_VALUE]

The output should look as follows:
    1. sort by size: [-143, -2, 1, 8, 45, 87, 98, 435, Integer.MAXIMUM_VALUE]
    2. sort by sized reversed: [Integer.MAXIMUM_VALUE, 435, 98, 87, 45, 8, 1, -2, -143]
    3. sort by number of chars: [1, 8, -2, 45, 87, 98, 435, -143, Integer.MAXIMUM_VALUE]

Make sure to use your own implementations of the sorting algorithms instead of the ones that are already given by
the java.util.Collection<E> Interface!!!

BONUS REQUIREMENTS:
-   Think of a way to make the sorting algorithms more generic, i.e. be able to sort lists of different data types.
-   Create a new sorting algorithm of your choice and implement it so the program is able to use it with the already
    existing data.
-   Which design pattern can be used to make the code more maintainable / extendable?
